# gitlab_scripts

## Project Overview
This project will contain all sorts of scripts that can control our company Gitlab instance from the command line.

## Requirements
Most of these will be _bash_ scripts so they probably need *nix or [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows 10](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/)

## Usage
From your project directory:
`./create_repo.sh`

Follow the prompts and a new repository will be created for you on the company Gitlab instance.

## To-Do
* No validation is being done on the script's inputs
* Add a default list of company developers to each new project
